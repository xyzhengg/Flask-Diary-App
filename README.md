### Flask-Diary-App

## About the app
This app was created with the purpose of connecting couples in long distance relationships, or who are 
separated for extended periods. 

It allows two users to contribute to a shared diary so they can stay connected with each others lives despite their distance and time differences. The app will display both participants posts on the same page to create a sense of unity, while also allowing each user to view only their own or their partners' posts. 

## Explanations of the technologies used
This app was created using Flask, with Python, CSS, HTML, Javascript, and Progresql

## The approach taken


## Installation instructions
